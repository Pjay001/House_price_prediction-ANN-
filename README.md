## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook contains Python code to predict the price of a property based on various features using a machine learning model. It utilizes a neural network implemented with PyTorch to perform the prediction. The model is trained on a dataset containing property features such as area, number of bedrooms, presence of wardrobe, AC, and playground.

## Dependencies
- pandas
- matplotlib
- numpy
- torch

## Usage
1. Make sure you have all the dependencies installed. If not, you can install them using pip:
    ```
    pip install pandas matplotlib numpy torch
    ```

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook in your preferred Python environment.

3. Execute each cell in the notebook sequentially by pressing Shift + Enter or by using the "Run" button in your Jupyter environment.

4. Follow the prompts in the notebook to enter the values for the features of the property you want to predict the price for. The notebook will then output the predicted price based on the trained model.
